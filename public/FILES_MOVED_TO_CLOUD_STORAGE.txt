This directory previously contained PDF files and thumbnails, but they have been moved to Google Cloud Storage for better scalability and security.

PDF files are now stored in the Cloud Storage bucket specified by BUCKET_PDFS environment variable.
Thumbnails are stored in the Cloud Storage bucket specified by BUCKET_THUMBNAILS environment variable.

To add new files:
1. Upload PDFs to the designated Cloud Storage bucket
2. Generate thumbnails and upload them to the thumbnails bucket
3. Update the database with the file URLs

This ensures files are served via HTTPS and are not tracked in the repository.
